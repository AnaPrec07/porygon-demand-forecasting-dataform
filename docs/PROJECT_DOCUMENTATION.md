# Dataform Project Documentation

## Overview
This project implements a professional Dataform workflow for demand forecasting, including feature engineering, target generation, and reporting for Walmart data.

## Folder Structure
- `definitions/`: Contains all SQLX definitions for features, targets, and reporting tables.
- `includes/`: JavaScript helper modules for reusable logic.
- `docs/`: Documentation and data model diagrams.
- `workflow_settings.yaml`: Dataform workflow configuration.

## Best Practices
- Use modular SQLX and JS includes for maintainability.
- Document all tables and features.
- Use version control and code reviews for all changes.
- Keep sensitive data out of the repository (use environment variables).
